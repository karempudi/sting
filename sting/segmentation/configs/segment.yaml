# Segmentation network training parameters all 
# parameters need, including network hyper parameters
# are written in the is file. It is used to train 
# models for segmentation of cells and channels
Model:

Save:
  directory: '/mnt/sda2/Praneeth/REALTIME/seg_expts' # main direcotry that contains all training runs

Logging:
  directory: '/mnt/sda2/Praneeth/REALTIME/seg_expts'

Datasets:
  directory: '/mnt/sda2/Praneeth/REALTIME/data/omnipose'
  # follow the documentation in datasets for directory structure
  type:  'omni_train_cells' 
  # 'omni_train_cells', 'unet_train_cells', 'omni_train_dual', 'unet_train_dual'
  # 'omni_train_channels', 'unet_train_channels'
  # duals are when you learn channels and cells in the same model
  species: 
    - mixed

  transforms: # write transforms depending on the dataset

Metrics:

PreTrain:
  load_params: False # load a model file and use a pretrainied parameters, default is False
  model_filename: # file used to load pretrained weights of the model

Checkpoints:
  load_ckpt: False # Incase the training stops, we should load from checkpoint and restart
  ckpt_filename: # ckpt filename from which to load the experiment to restart
