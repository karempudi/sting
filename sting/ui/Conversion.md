### Converting the .ui file made in QtDesigner

QtDesigner will help you design your UI and produces a .ui file.
We need to use this file to generate .py class that produces the ui when
instantited. The buttons and other control aspects need to be hooked up
after you instantiate the class generated by PyQt5. 

Note: For some reason I don't want to get into, conda throws errors when
you use PySide6. So we will stick to using PyQt5 instead. I read that it 
has something to do with matplotlib backend.

Command to convert .ui to .py files

```
python -m PyQt5.uic.pyuic -x .\qt_ui_files\main_window.ui -o .\qt_ui_classes\main_window_ui.py
```
